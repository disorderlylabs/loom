Usage of time window to decrease number of hypotheses. 

Modules that occur too frequently are removed: 80\% of log lines removed via this technique. 

Challenge: Identifying two events as the same across hypotheses sets

Single key can have multiple key matches.

Approach 1: Selection of specific key based on criteria

Intersection of dependencies with 
\begin{itemize}
\item Union of dependencies of all matching keys
\item Intersection of dependencies of all matching keys
\item Matching key such that the cardinality of intersection is maximised
\item Matching key such that the cardinality of intersection is maximised
\end{itemize}

Approach 2: Weighting

No dependencies are discarded from one run to the next, rather a count of the number of times each dependency is seen is maintained. 

After a certain number of runs, we throw away dependencies that whose number of occurrences falls below a certain threshold
