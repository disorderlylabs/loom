Establishing dependencies amongst events is only relevant to distributed executions.
\begin{itemize}
\item Since a total order can be established for events on a single thread of execution
\end{itemize}

The dependencies that we postulate amongst events under consideration should, in the ideal case, be:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Sound:  
All relationships postulated should be true.
\item Complete:
All true relationships should be postulated.
\end{enumerate}

These two requirements are in opposition with each other. 

Two naive approaches:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Events only have dependencies on the same node: 
Sound but not complete. Will miss important dependencies. 

\item Events depend on all preceding events that occurred on a different node: 
Complete but not sound. Will not miss any dependencies, but dependency graph likely to be extremely dense and unrepresentative of truth.
\end{enumerate}

We start with the complete dependency graph and try to make it as sound as possible.
